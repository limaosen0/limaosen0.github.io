>Facial attributes transfer is a challenging problem in computer vision and image processing. We propose a new structure for local facial attributes transfer, called Dual Discriminative Adversarial Networks (DDAN). Given a source image with a certain local attribute, the DDAN model transforms source images with a certain attribute to target images without the same attribute while keeping the other attributes unchanged. A two-branch discriminator is introduced in the proposed DDAN model to simultaneously represent local and global features. 

# Introduction
- What is local facial attributes? Local facial attributes indicate that some specific attributes appear at local regions of the faces. For example, wearing glasses, mouth open and mustaches. In contrary, global facial attributes denote features on the whole faces which represent more abstract information of people, such as genders and ages. 
- The challenging of local factial attributes transferring.
- Example of global/local facial attributes transferring.
