>Facial attributes transfer is a challenging problem in computer vision and image processing. We propose a new structure for local facial attributes transfer, called Dual Discriminative Adversarial Networks (DDAN). Given a source image with a certain local attribute, the DDAN model transforms source images with a certain attribute to target images without the same attribute while keeping the other attributes unchanged. A two-branch discriminator is introduced in the proposed DDAN model to simultaneously represent local and global features.
